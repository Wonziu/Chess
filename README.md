# Here are rules of Atomic Chess
- As in normal chess check still fully applies. However if a player's king is in check he has nevertheless the ability to win by exploding his opponents king. Also as the king cannot take another piece, it is possible to move the kings next to each other. In this case check does not apply. In a further variant of atomic chess, check is not enforced at all.
- There is no en passant.

- When capturing enemy's piece, both pieces are removed from game. Furthermore all surrounding pieces, except for pawns, are also removed.

- When pawn reaches the last square, it explodes instead of chaning to other piece.
